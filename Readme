CEF207 – Tutorial Sheet 2 first semester.

Exercise.   2.1  Input  two numbers   and  work  out their  sum, average and  sum  of the  squares   of   the 
numbers.

Exercise. 2.2 Write a program that works out the largest and smallest values from a set of 10 inputted 
numbers.

Exercise. 2.3 Given as input a floating (real) number of centimeters, print out the equivalent number of 
feet (integer) and inches (floating, 1 decimal), with the inches given to an accuracy of one decimal 
place.
Assume 2.54 centimeters per inch, and 12 inches per foot.
If the input value is 333.3, the output format should be:
333.3 centimeters is 10 feet 11.2 inches.

Exercise. 2.4 Write a program which reads two integer values. If the first is less than the second, print 
the message up. If the second is less than the first, print the message down If the numbers are equal, 
print the message equal If there is an error reading the data, print a message containing the word Error 
and perform exit( 0 );
Exercise. 2.5 Read an integer value. Assume it is the number of a month of the year; print out the name 
of that month.

Exercise. 2.6 Write a program to output an integer in decimal format and a floating point number in 
float format. Experiment with outputting an integer in float format and visa versa. Output a character 
in decimal format (prints the character code e.g. ascii). Fix any problems by using an explicit type 
coercion or cast. 

Exercise.  2.7  Write a program to input an integer, n, between 1 and 9, and print a line of output 
consisting of digits from 1 to n, followed by descending digits from (n­1) to 1. For example, if n = 6, 
then the output will be 
12345654321

Exercise. 2.8 Write a program which requests two integers, m and n, and produces a table of squares 
from m to n inclusive.

Exercise. 2.9 Write a program to read an integer from 1 to 999 and print the integer in words. E.g if 897 
is read, the program prints
eight hundred and ninety­seven

Exercise. 2.10 Write a program which converts an integer into Roman numerals.
